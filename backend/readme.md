# Backend Service

This backend service is designed to handle various tasks through two main agent workflows: the **SQL Agent** and the **Research Agent**. Each agent is responsible for specific functionalities and operations within the service.

## Agent Workflows

### SQL Agent

The SQL Agent is responsible for managing database interactions, executing queries, and performing data manipulation tasks. It provides a robust interface for interacting with SQL databases and handling data retrieval and updates efficiently.
